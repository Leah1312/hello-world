GIST604B - Module 1
I am a graduate student working towards a degree in GIST. My interest in mapping began in childhood, sitting in the back of my dad's pickup staring at Rand McNally for hours during our driving trips around the country. Since then, I discovered the power and usability of spatial mapping and decided this was a path I would like to take.
